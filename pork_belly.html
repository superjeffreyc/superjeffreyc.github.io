<h1>Pork Belly with Bean Curd</h1>
  
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Pork belly (pork shoulder or pork butt will work as alternatives)</li>
    <li>Dry Bean Curd</li>
    <li>Scallion</li>
    <li>Soy Sauce</li>
    <li>Dark Soy Sauce</li>
    <li>Chinese cooking wine</li>
    <li>Brown sugar</li>
  </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Blanch the pork belly (place in a pot of water, bring to boil, and turn off flame for 30 minutes)</li>
    <li>Pour out all the water and rinse the pork belly thoroughly to remove impurities</li>
    <li>Cut the pork belly into thin, bite sized slices (Note: it is still raw)</li>
    <li>Clean the pot and place the slices of pork belly back into the pot</li>
    <li>Add a few swirls of soy sauce, chinese cooking wine, and dark soy sauce to the pot (a swirl is one circular motion around the pot)</li>
    <li>Add some cold water to the pot to bring the total liquid volume to about half of the pork belly volume</li>    
    <li>Add a small stick of brown sugar</li>
    <li>Keep on medium-low flame and let it simmer for several hours</li>
    <li>In the meantime, pour the dry bean curd into a bowl and submerge in cold water to soften it</li>
    <li>Chop the scallions</li>
    <li>Once the pork belly has reduced slightly, consider draining the oil and removing impurities to make it healthier and presentable</li>
    <li>Add more salt/sugar as needed</li>
    <li>Once the liquid has almost reduced, add in the dry bean curd and mix well</li>
    <li>The sauce should have a much thicker texture when its done</li>
    <li>Add the chopped scallions as a garnish</li>
  </ol>
