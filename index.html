<h1>Hi, my name is Jeffrey Chan</h1>
	<p>I am a senior at Binghamton University with an interest in firmware and software development. I am comfortable using Python, C/C++, and Java. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Science with an expected graduation date of May 2017.

While interning at IBM, I developed firmware to allow IBM customers to collect diagnostic data which enables customers to monitor the status of their machines and undergo preventative maintenance if needed. In addition, I created a non-disruptive logging service for the LPAR Hypervisor. This service resolves issues with space limitations and provides data when a dump is not available, providing First Error Data Capture for the team.

Outside of school, I enjoy working on group projects where I can challenge myself to solve interesting problems. For example, I have attended hackathons such as HackRPI 2015 and HackBU 2016 to rapidly prototype an application and have fun in the process. 

My hobbies include table tennis, volleyball, piano, birdwatching, and video games.
