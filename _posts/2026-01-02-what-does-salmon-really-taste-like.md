I've come to a realization that I've been using salmon as a vessel for sugar. Whether it was a sticky honey glaze or sweet soy sauce, I wasn't eating fish—I was eating the sauce.
After some time, I had to ask myself, was I really tasting the salmon? Could I still enjoy salmon without drowning it in sugar? What does salmon really taste like?

### The Hidden Truth

Look at your teriyaki sauce bottle, or look at one the next time you are at the grocery store (or if you make your own, look at your recipe). Some
brands contain over 50% added sugar by weight! This means that two tablespoons of these store-bought sauces contain roughly **16 grams** of sugar! To put
that into perspective, a standard sugar cube is 4 grams. Would you still eat a salmon fillet if there were 4 cubes of sugar sitting on top of it?

### The Experiment

I wanted to see if I could cut down on the amount of added sugar. I decided to just season the salmon with salt alone and steam it.

Steaming is the quietest way to cook. It doesn't distract your taste buds with the char of a grill or the added oil from frying; it forces the ingredients to speak for themselves.

Pro-tip: Do a 10-minute salt. By seasoning the fillet at least 10 minutes prior to steaming, the salt has time to dissolve into a brine and penetrate the center of the fish. You aren't just salting the fish; you are seasoning the water inside it.

### The Verdict

Because this dish only had two ingredients, there was nowhere for the flavor to hide. Without any sugar to hide behind, I was actually tasting the salmon.

#### The Profile

Delicate, buttery, and surprisingly sweet due to the natural salmon fats.

#### The Discovery

I realized that sweetness doesn't have to come from the sauce. When steamed properly with minimal seasoning, the salmon carries its own sweetness.

#### Would I eat it again?

Absolutely. Salmon has shifted from one of my sugar cravings to a weeknight staple.

### The Challenge

The next time you cook salmon, try using half the sauce you normally would. Does the flavor of the fish come forward?

### The Recipe: The Intentional Salmon

* **Prep Time:** 15 Minutes
* **Cook Time:** 5-7 Minutes
* **Servings:** 1 Fillet

---

#### Ingredients
* **1 Salmon Fillet** (Skin-on preferred)
* **High-quality Salt** (Kosher or Sea Salt)
* **Fresh Herbs** (Optional: Dill, Parsley, or Chives)

#### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Steamer:** Fill a large pot with 1-2 inches of water. Place your steaming tray inside and bring to a boil.
2. **Prep the Skin:** Use a butter knife to gently de-scale the salmon skin. Rinse thoroughly under cold water and pat dry.
3. **The 10-Minute Salt:** Lightly sprinkle both sides of the fillet with salt.
    > **Note:** Don't skip the wait! Giving the salt 10 minutes allows it to dissolve into a brine that seasons the salmon from the inside out.
4. **Steam:** Once the water is at a rolling boil, place the salmon on the tray and cover with a tight-fitting lid.
5. **Cook:** Lower the flame to medium. Steam for approximately **5-7 minutes**.
6. **Rest and Garnish:** Carefully remove the salmon. Let it rest for 1 minute, then garnish with fresh herbs if desired.
