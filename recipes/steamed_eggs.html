<h1>Steamed Eggs</h1>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>6 Eggs</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Water</li>
    <li>Shrimp (optional)</li>
    <li>Steaming platform</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Crack 6 eggs into a bowl and add salt for taste</li>
    <li>Remember the volume of eggs by looking how far up the bowl the eggs are</li>
    <li>Pour the eggs into a larger bowl for steaming</li>
    <li>Add an equal volume of water</li>
    <li>Optionally, add the shrimp here and add additional salt for taste</li>
    <li>Mix well</li>    
    <li>Add water and a steaming platform to the wok</li>
    <li>Once the water is boiling, turn the heat down to medium-low flame and place the steaming bowl onto the steaming platform</li>
    <li>Close the lid and let it steam for 8-10 minutes, though time may vary (it is important to cook it slowly)</li>
    <li>You can occasionally check the doneness but just be aware you may lose some steam by checking. It should be silky and not watery.</li>
  </ol>
